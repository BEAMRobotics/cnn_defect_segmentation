## Convolutional Neural Networks for Defect Segmetation

This software repository contains tools to work with 3D point clouds and images for autmating inspections. 

### Bridge Inspection

#### bridge_image_labeler
Run the script image_labeler.m in matlab for tools to help label images on a pixel-wise level. This code is specific for bridge inspection. 

#### Instructions: cnn_defect_segmentation
Keras implementation of Deeplab V3+ (MobileNet or Xception). This model can be trained for semantic pixel-wise segmentation of defects of any number of classes/
