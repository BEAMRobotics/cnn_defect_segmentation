Training 1 (softmax)
2018-11-27
mobilenet-v2
Loss = CCE; Opt = SGD; LR = 0.005; momentum = 0.9; decay = 0.005/500;
batch_size = 4; steps_per_epoch = 100; epochs = 500;
loss = 0.0166; mIOU = 0.7106; val_loss = 0.0560; val_mIOU = 0.7946
May have made mistake with steps per epoch, but doesn't really matter. Should 
still rerun if time permits
